# University-Progression-Outcome-Predictor

Overview

The "University Progression Outcome Predictor" is a Python program designed to assist students in predicting their academic progression outcomes at the end of each academic year. The program considers the results of six modules, each contributing 20 marks. The outcomes are determined based on a set of rules and criteria provided by the university.

Features

1. User Input and Validation:

The program prompts users to input the number of credits for each module—Pass, Defer, and Fail.
Validations are in place to ensure the input is within the allowed range (0 to 120) and that the total credits equal 120.

2. Outcome Prediction:

The program calculates the total marks and predicts the progression outcome based on the provided rules.
Outcomes include "Progress," "Do not Progress – Module Retriever," and "Exclude."

3. Multiple Outcomes:

The program considers various scenarios, such as passing all modules, having a module trailer, or failing multiple modules.

4. Histogram Visualization:

A histogram is generated to visually represent the distribution of students across different progression outcomes.

5. Lists and Dictionaries:

The program utilizes lists and dictionaries to store and manage data efficiently.

6. User-defined Functions:

Functions are implemented to encapsulate logical operations, making the code modular and easy to understand.
